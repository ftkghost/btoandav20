## What is it

**btoandav20** is a package to integrate OANDA into [backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/).
It uses the [v20](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/) API of OANDA. It can be used with demo or live account.

## Order Types

btoandav20 supports Market, Limit and Stop orders. Other order types, like StopTrail need to be created using brackets.

### StopTrail order

orderexec: bt.Order.Stop

stopexec: bt.Order.StopTrail

### Changing StopTrail order

To change a StopTrail order the stopside or takeside needs to be canceled and a new order with the order type StopTrail needs to be created.

Also an oref of the original order needs to be provided, when creating this order.
The order needs to go into the opposing direction.

**StopTrail example:**

Provide the stoptrail in stopargs with trailamount or trailpercent

* o, ostop, olimit = buy_bracket(exectype=bt.Order.Stop, stopexec=bt.Order.StopTrail, stopargs={"trailamount": xxx or "trailpercent": yyy} limitexec=None)

Create new trailing stop for parent order

* self.sell(exectype=bt.Order.StopTrail, trailamount=xxx or trailpercent=yyy, replace=ostop.ref)
